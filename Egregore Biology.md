## **The Brain**

imagine spikes of ideas in the memesphere (?) or knowledge graphs as spikes in the brain

## The Skin

imagine the "shape" of the graph as the skin of the Egregore
the skin can be implemented using soft body physics

## The Bones

links between nodes are like bones

## The Gut Biome
imagine subgraphs as the "gut biome" of the egregore, which together give rise to behaviors in the egregore

## Fossils

once you have a biology framework for egregores, you can begin to imagine "fossils" of egregores of the past
and begin to apply the idea of "egregores" to other species besides humans
like in these fossilized anthills
which represent the "mind" of the ant hive mind
