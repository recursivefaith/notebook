## Notes
**1359** `<recursivefaith/content.git>` Standardized the format of daily log headings in `changelog.md` to include the day of the week, enhancing readability. 
**1356** `<recursivefaith/content.git>` Manually reordered daily logs and changelog entries to reverse chronological order, completing the task for standardizing historical data display. 
**1350** `<recursivefaith/content.git>` Standardized reverse chronological ordering for daily logs and notes across all entries in `Oz.md`, including new content and a `.bashrc` update. 
**1323** similar wave length to what i've been saying about [[Living Digital Gardens]] and the video I made yesterday
![[media/Pasted image 20250825132335.png]]
**1318** `<recursivefaith/hey.git>` Refactored the `git.sh` script's `awk` insertion logic, changing how new entries are added to history and changelog files. It now prioritizes insertion immediately after the first `## Notes` heading, then any `##` heading, otherwise appending to the end. 
**1306** `<recursivefaith/content.git>` Refactored daily logging by migrating `History.md` content into `Oz.md` and deleting the old file. This commit also mirrors the `.bashrc` configuration and adds new organizational notes for opportunities, scratchpad, and chores. 
**1149** damn i have extremely good conversations on [[ORI]]
**1121** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` Refined the Matrix Rain effect by significantly increasing its falling speed range and extending its interactive triggers to include checkboxes, dynamically styling the rain based on their checked state. Additionally, styled checkboxes with a custom border color. 
**1121** `<recursivefaith/content.git>` Refactor content by migrating daily logs to `Oz.md`, moving previous `Oz` content to `Research.md`, and updating daily tasks. This commit centralizes daily and dream logs in `Oz.md` for better accessibility, while relocating older "Work sample" content to a new `Research.md` file. The 25-08-25 task list is updated to reflect these migrations and includes new Substack writing goals. Additionally, the changelog is updated, and an unused daily log base file is removed. 
**1052** [[Egregore Bones]] - Use soft body physics to generate "creatures" around the "shape" of data
**1030** Been thinking about [[Egregore Cosmology]]
**0909** Gonna start thinking about migrating away from Obsidian completely to the pure QR Code concept, but I'll keep using Obsidian as a kind of "entry" to this concept, so that I can overlap the Obsidian/Personal Knowledge Base communities
**0846** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` Updated the `content` git submodule to its latest commit. 
**0845** `<recursivefaith/content.git>` Added a new daily log for 25-08-25 (Monday) and reorganized the `History.md` to display daily entries in reverse chronological order. This commit also introduces a new media asset and updates the changelog with recent styling refinements. 
**0841** OK! Never thought of this but with AI I guess it's possible: gonna try and write my diaries in full reverse chronological order, so the latest notes go first...this way visitors can just refresh the page to see the latest notes, also it helps me mentally eg if i have a bad morning or feel down or whatever, i can just write more to "drown it out", this could help me be mindful of actually changing/forgetting the vibe instead of ruminating
**0747** Whoo! OK feeling better after that rant and some coffee haha gonna start sharing my artwork on twitter and discord

**Sleep:** 53 (0153-0455)

**1145** coffee
**1030** coffee
**0837** *Feel much better!* 
**0815** coffee
**0740** coffee
**0708** coffee, 25mg - (*rant, doomer mindset*) i feel "stuck" and existential this week, I still only have 35 followers on X and there's a feeling that I won't be getting any funding any time soon. I really think [[Living Digital Gardens]] is the path forward but I'm not sure how to articulate this at all. I mean I feel like I'm doing good! But I can't seem to connect with people socially. I feel like I have so much potential but it's just not being utilized or seen. I've been very early and even catalyzed different trends but it feels so competitive, I want to research and build alongside people not compete with people. But it's so hard to feel positive. Not getting sleep and chilling on exercise is likely contributing, so is falling behind on bills. I mean I'm doing survey's working for pennies like what a aweful waste I could be collaborating or doing actually useful things, and the frustrating thing is that I WANT TO be collaborating. It feels like everyone is just yapping and not many people are actually doing things. I need to get the copilot working so I can chat inside of these diaries, that will help me and also sell the vision a bit more, I just need funding man I need a few hundred dollars to "get on my feet" so I can accelerate it's too stressful right now like I have $40 for food until the 5th...i dont get it you can yap on twitter and get UBI thru ad share, but you can't simply contribute to open source without it making money for someone else first. I gotta figure out a way to transcend this. I think I'm on the right path, just gotta keep going. Oof today is going to be a hard day ðŸ¥²

		- [x] Start Handsfree Button
		- [x] Migrate documentation here
	- [ ] Morpheus
		- [x] Add matrix rain as background
		- [x] Fix git agent

## Notes
**0132** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` Refined mobile page title styling in `custom.scss` to target `<span>` elements, aligning with the refactored Quartz page title HTML structure.  
**0116** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` Refactored Quartz page title HTML structure and updated CSS to apply gradient text styling to individual `<span>` elements, slightly adjusting the gradient's transition.  
**0051** `<recursivefaith/content.git>` Integrated Matrix Rain visual effects into Quartz and added related styling, along with new custom CSS for Quartz elements like horizontal rules and borders. A new image asset was also included and referenced in the daily log.  
**0051** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` Updates the `content` submodule and refines Quartz styling by adding custom CSS for horizontal rules, popover borders, and graph borders.  
**0045** looks really good wow, filling in every cell gives if an Animated GIF like vibe  
![[media/Pasted image 20250825004551.png]]  
**0035** `<recursivefaith/content.git>` Refined the Matrix Rain visual effect by adjusting its canvas placement, adding fade-out CSS for reader mode, and enhancing its interactivity and styling with HSL gradients and new triggers.  
**0034** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` Refined the Matrix Rain visual effect with detailed HSL color gradients, ensuring white stream tips, and extending triggers to include the `Tab` key. It also introduces interactive rain when hovering over internal links, distinguishing between resolved (info) and unresolved (negative) links.  
**2345** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` Refined the Matrix Rain visual effect by re-parenting its canvas to the `html` element and adding custom CSS to smoothly fade it out when reader mode is enabled. The `content` submodule was also updated.  
**2328** `<recursivefaith/content.git>` Fixed the Morpheus git agent, integrated a new Matrix Rain visual effect with refined styling, and applied custom scrollbar styling. Updated daily logs with these changes, additional health entries, and expense details.  
**2327** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` Refined Matrix Rain effect by increasing the initial opacity of trickle streams.  
**2321** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` Integrated a new Matrix Rain visual effect by adding `matrix.js` and linking it in the `Head` component, while also updating the `content` submodule and disabling custom Open Graph image generation.  
**2159** `<recursivefaith/morpheus.git>` Refined scrollbar styling by changing the default thumb background color to `---color-2`.  
**2142** `<recursivefaith/content.git>` Updated the changelog and daily history with recent git messages related to the `git.sh` script's insertion logic refinements and `custom.scss` updates. The changelog also received an introductory note and structural improvements with horizontal separators between daily entries.  
**2142** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` Updated the `content` submodule and added custom CSS to `custom.scss` for styling scrollbars, setting them to be square and using theme-defined color variables.  
**2137** `<recursivefaith/hey.git>` Refactored the `git.sh` script's `awk` insertion logic to place new git messages _after_ the last non-blank line preceding the `---` and `#` heading sequence, ensuring chronological order.  
**2132** `<recursivefaith/hey.git>` The `git.sh` script's `awk` insertion logic has been refined to allow for optional empty lines between the `---` separator and the `#` heading when inserting new git messages, ensuring chronological order.  
**2128** `<recursivefaith/hey.git>` Refactored the `git.sh` script to modify its `awk` insertion logic. New git messages are now inserted **above** the `---` separator line when it's immediately followed by a `#` heading, ensuring chronological order.  
**2126** `<recursivefaith/hey.git>` Refactored the `git.sh` script to update its `awk` insertion logic, which now identifies a `---` line immediately followed by a `#` heading to insert new git messages below it. This ensures chronological ordering (newest first) within the history and changelog files, falling back to appending if the specific marker sequence isn't found.  
**2117** Wow that works great ha! Now it will add commit messages chronologically even as i type. I would rather do it without the marker below, but for now this is great. Actually let's just vibe code it why not  
**2117** `<recursivefaith/hey.git>` The `git.sh` script now requires a `CHANGELOG` environment variable and the `awk` command. It has been refactored to use `awk` to insert new git messages above a specific marker in both the history and changelog files, ensuring chronological order.  
**2110** `<recursivefaith/content.git>` The changelog and daily history logs have been refactored and reordered chronologically (newest entries first), with a placeholder for new git messages now located at the top of the changelog. The daily log for 25-08-24 has been expanded with new tasks, bookmarks, and personal reflections, and there's a note about updating the git agent's insertion logic.  
**2038** Whoops forgot that I need to update the git agent to insert above the first --- followed by # since this is now in chronological order  
**2036** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` Refactored content within the `content` submodule, improved social image generation by adding error handling, and updated `custom.scss` to hide Handsfree.js elements by default.  
**2030** `<recursivefaith/content.git>` Refactored content and file structure by moving daily logs and other notes into a new `notes` directory, updated existing daily entries with new content, and added a new media asset.  
**2020** Use projection mapping to "display" a bird landing on my finger from the knowledge graph  
**2016** ðŸ’¡quote tweet chain idea - quote tweets chains instead of threads, then you have to "dig into" the thread vs scrolling it, every few threads, mention ETH (or some crypto that I can do this with)

text

`graph TD 	ETH-->Garden 	Garden-->ETH`

**1954** rearranged the history from top to bottom, will do same for [[changelog]]  
**1929** it's a different experience building a digital garden vs a startup as "the thing you do". with the startup mindset its hard to dissacociate money from "value", so if i dont have a lot of money i can feel like im "value less". but for independent research it's the wrong mindset, rather it's the research itself that is the value. it feels fucking great to have a goal or project to work on! i would like to raise money of course so that i can explore more ideas and even pay others to help me...gotta iron out my $250k stretch goal and explain it better and richer

made with veo 3  
![[media/Prismatic_Garden_of_Eden_Video-ezgif.com-optimize.gif]]  
**1839** `<recursivefaith/content.git>` This commit largely migrates the extensive Handsfree.js documentation into a new `notes/handsfree` directory, encompassing guides, examples, API references, and gesture definitions. It also updates the daily history with a new task for this documentation migration.  
**1829** `<recursivefaith/content.git>` The user has updated their daily log and changelog for August 24, 2025. Key changes include marking the "Start Handsfree Button" task as complete, adding a new task to set up a contact page, and detailing a personal reflection on social media growth and burnout.  
**1823** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` Begins integrating Handsfree.js for handsfree interaction  
**1431** I feel a little sad that my X/Twitter growth has stagnated...feels incredibly hard to grow and I'm becoming disillusioned with even bothering anymore. It's been nearly 10 years of consistently contributing to big projects (Handsfree.js, MediaPipe, Websim, many others) and getting minimal and sometimes literally zero support. I feel optimistic still but i am starting to get burned out :(...gonna do some coding see if that lifts mood :D)  
**1108** `<recursivefaith/content.git>` Enriched the daily log for 25-08-23 (Saturday) with detailed health, money, and bookmark entries, including a new image. A new daily log for 25-08-24 (Sunday) was also added with its initial tasks and health data.

**Dream:** Dreamt that I was playing Fallout 2 but in a kind of first-person 3rd view? like I was in the suit but there was also a Heads Up Display of myself...so I was seeing thru my eyes but also seeing myself from above, it was very trippy

The dream, once again, took place in this [[dream city|city-village]] I keep dreaming about, that reminds me of Springfield, MA but themed like it was in an Iraqi desert

In the dream I was suddenly looking at a Diablo 3 interface, while still "feeling" like im in Fallout 2. I had started exploring the city and I remember distinctly that i kept travelling westward. I ended up at a kind of outdoor market and after a battle looted some of the items, including a power armor that required 18 STR...as I started rolling dice to see how many points I could use I woke up

**2143** `<recursivefaith/content.git>` Updated the README to feature a new `og-image.png` and promote the Quartz website and Morpheus AI Copilot. The commit also marks the favicon update task as complete in the daily history log.  
**2118** `<recursivefaith/content.git>` This update extensively expands the project's content by adding numerous media assets and new notes, reorganizing documentation across health, Morpheus, and portfolio topics. It also includes a typography refinement for the Morpheus plugin website.  
**2117** `<recursivefaith/morpheus.git>` This commit refines website typography by hiding the first letter of standard inline titles and subtly adjusting the gradient effect on "Morpheus" themed titles. It also introduces styling for emphasized text within the CodeMirror editor.  
**2050** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` Added a new Git submodule named `content`, pointing to `git@github.com:recursivefaith/notebook.git`. This integrates an external repository as a subfolder within the current project.  
**2034** `<recursivefaith/content.git>` This commit primarily refactors image asset management by moving all visual media files into a dedicated `media/` directory and updating all internal references in Markdown files to reflect these new paths. It ensures consistent organization and linking of images across the repository.  
**2026** `<recursivefaith/content.git>` This commit refines the repository's setup for Obsidian and Quartz, including a new `Opportunities` document and updated `README.md`. It also consolidates recent daily log entries and changelog information, notably referencing the migration of content into a new `content` git submodule for the public-facing digital garden.  
**1855** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` The deployment workflow is updated to recursively check out Git submodules during the build process. This ensures that all submodules, such as the newly introduced `content` submodule, are properly fetched for deployment to GitHub Pages.  
**1850** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` Extensively refactored content by introducing a new `content` git submodule, migrating daily logs and reflections into it to establish a public-facing digital garden. This update also included a new `og-image.png` and refined task lists.  
**1849** `<recursivefaith/content.git>` This commit extensively refactors the project's content and structure, migrating daily logs, changelogs, and personal reflections into a public-facing "digital garden." It introduces comprehensive philosophical notes defining "Recursive Faith" and "Gnosis Copilot," alongside integrating multimedia and project demos, all tailored for an AI audience.  
**1754** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` This commit adds a new image and integrates it into the "Transmigration" epiphany note. It also extensively updates the daily logs for August 22nd and 23rd, detailing Handsfree.js integration, personal reflections, and task progress.

**1149** OH this beautifully captures my "[[notes/epiphanies/transmigration|encoding myself into qr codes]]" concept  
**1045** Huzzah! Disconnected for about 36hrs to recharge, i feel GREAT but a bit "slow" ðŸ˜… I think i had some anxiety around publishing Handsfree.js (as i often do), but this revival will be hyperfocused on being my interaction layer to this digital garden

## Health
**Sleep:** 82 (0031-0814) - Sleep was GOOD, had nightmares but still slept great wow
**Dream:** Had a kind of lucid nightmare, triggered I think by overheating at night. Noticed that turning on the AC helped me get some deep deep sleep :)

The nightmare was kind of traumatic, it was recursive. I was in some kind of experiment at a residential psyche ward that felt fun to be at at first. It was a kind of schizo university and everyone had schizo powers where people could summon entities (thematically it looked like a ward but the "feeling" was that i was in a university)

I had gained lucidity at one point and went outside, I was near one of Portland's Bridges in 3rd perspective and flying around and doing silly dream things I can't remember. I remember visiting foodcarts and eating i think tacos

At one point someone summoned an "ender beast" (what we called it) and suddenly there was a feeling that i was in a simulation. I still had some lucidity in that i felt like i could make my own choices, but it was limited in that i couldn't control the theme/nightmare switch

The dream played out like a video game, Sonic the Hedgehog in 3D, and I was escaping the ender beast (kinda like The Nothing from Never Ending Story or SSERP from Pantheon). There was a violent segment of the dream where I had to watch my friends get consumed by the Ender Beast

At one point I went into the basement and there was an inner acknowledgement that this would make the dream worse (basements are always scary in my dreams) but it was the only way i could escape. At one point I turned myself into a cat to see if I could hide from the beast and it seemed to work, but it kept attacking the other people and was scary. Then I kept "waking up" into other people at the ward. At first I would "wake up" confused feeling like I was in reality but then I would notice that I was looking at myself in 3rd person, gain some lucidity, and acccidentally lure the beast. At one point it was spawn-camping me and I woke up super fast like 10 times in a second

When I woke up for real I was sweating but fell back to sleep quickly, I had another silly dream but I can't remember any details of it

## Notes
**1559** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` This commit refactors the website's core content, standardizing internal links and author references to lowercase. It introduces a new 'Sprint 2' planning document and updates the main `index` page with a clearer manifesto and new navigation links.  
**1152** I think im gonna stop listening to podcasts while multitasking (eg chores) because I don't seem to actually retain anything, and anything even slightly technical becomes hard to follow. Instead, I'll set time aside specifically for podcasts and switch to Eckhart Tolle's method of simply being present with the chores (while listening to music ofc)  
**1044** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` This commit heavily refactors the website's content and structure, introducing a new manifesto and standardizing timestamp formatting in logs. It also enhances the Quartz publishing setup with automatic lowercase slugs and refines the internal git agent's logging.  
**1008** `<recursivefaith/hey.git>` The `git.sh` script is updated to bold timestamps when generating history log entries. This standardizes the formatting of timestamps in the recorded history.  
**1007** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` This commit standardizes timestamp formatting by bolding them across changelog and daily log entries. It also updates the changelog with recent daily notes and adds a new daily log for August 20th, 2025.

**2359** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` The commit primarily refactors website content and configuration, including the deletion of a conceptual README and the addition of frontmatter to "epiphanies" notes. It also updates Quartz settings to prioritize frontmatter for date tracking and refines mobile styling for page titles and the reader mode button.
**2329** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` Refined website styling for mobile devices, reducing the page title font size and hiding the reader mode button for improved display on smaller screens.
**2325** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` Refined website styling by adjusting the font size of the page title on mobile devices for improved readability. The change targets screens with a maximum width of 768px, making the title smaller.
**2320** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` Refactored the website's main page structure and content, integrating new visual assets and reorganizing explanatory sections. Additionally, updated the site's styling to apply a bright color to italic and code elements, and appended a personal note to the daily log.
**2247** Updated my x profile to Oz âŠ· Ó¨Æ¶ to represent the transmigrated version of me
![[media/Pasted image 20250820224810.png]]

**2246** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` This commit adds a new image, updates the `History.md` log with task completion and new entries, and significantly refactors the `index.md` page by reordering content sections, refining text, and integrating new visual assets.
**2216** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` This commit primarily refactors content by adding new visual assets (GIFs and PNGs) to the homepage and updating existing log files to reflect recent changes, including the migration of some commit messages into `History.md`.
**2126** Would probably need to fund these somehow (eg for GPUs) so a crypto might help, a successful crypto would "out compete" other cryptos assuming crypto is also used to acquire base reality resources (gpus, building materials, etc...possibly energy could be gotten using [[concentrated solar energy]]
**2159** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` This commit heavily refactors the website's content and structure, moving work samples to a new "Oz" page, organizing content into a new "tutorials" directory, and updating branding assets. It also refines daily logs by removing personal dream entries and adjusts project roadmap details.
**2059** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` This commit heavily refactors the website's content and structure, introducing a new "Roadmap" on the index page, deleting numerous old daily logs while adding new entries, and importantly, modifying slug generation to preserve casing for internal links. It also updates the site's visual elements like the favicon and introduces new conceptual links.

**Recursive Faith is an interface**, so i have to make this less about me and more about helping others learn how to integrate the system (ofc need to prove the system myself)

```mermaid
graph LR
inside --> RecursiveFaith --> outside
outside --> RecursiveFaith --> inside
```
inside - self, me
outside - ai, others

**1948** ðŸ’¡ imagine looking at the screen I'm typing but from "inside the TV" looking at me, the "inside the tv" perspective is the [[Gnosis Copilot]]. Right now I see Obsidian, and anyone who visits https://recursive.faith will also see this, eventually in real time. So there's my perspective, the perspective of the Gnosis Copilot, the perspective of the observer viewing the prior two, but also the perspective of the visitors and agents and so on. And so "mixed and extended reality" isn't simply about augmenting physical reality with our individual worlds, but literally to mix and extend our realities and perspectives with each other
**1952** i think im building a good flow again, am going to start focusing a bit on health and leaning into the [[digital-self-archeology]] concept (which needs to be updated)
**1945** [[do all patterns have an afterlife?]]
**1939** i keep forgetting how powerful Obsidian is. I've been daily driving my own tools for so long, and I hadn't implemented that yet. This is where I'm at with the UI right now, I'm using an Obsidian metaphor

## Notes
**2327** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` This commit primarily populates and restructures the website, adding numerous media assets and a visual gallery to the main page, while also refining the author's profile. Concurrently, it extensively refactors the daily log, consolidating detailed daily notes, health, and financial tracking into `dailies/history.md`.  
**2225** Gotta start taking more notes throughout the day :D exercising again is definitely helping me get tired naturally near the end of the day. I still have some lingering sleep anxiety so may take seroquel again. I'm starting to get engagement on x which feels nice :D  
**1741** `<recursivefaith/hey.git>` Refined Git script for standardized repo references and dual history/changelog logging, alongside simplifying the internal git agent prompt.  
**1329** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` The commit deletes a temporary file, updates the changelog, and significantly refactors `dailies/history.md` by moving completed tasks and health logs to their respective dated sections for better organization and clarity.

## Health
**Sleep:** 90 (2317-0828)
**Dream:** Dream involved me and my a friend from my military days. In the dream we kept practicing the Melbourne Shuffle and going to clubs and getting into trouble. We had an epic dance off where we started flipping around like in those [AI gymnastics videos](https://www.reddit.com/r/aivideo/comments/1dt7qsa/ai_sports_gymnastics/)

There's a city I keep visiting in my dreams, it feels nostalgic like i grew up there but it's note quite right. It's a city that has the feeling of home but looks like the camp I lived in Iraq. Don't remember too much else except some car chase scenes and lots of dancing haha
