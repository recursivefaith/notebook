i kinda felt bad for the bot after posting this lol bc it implies the bot is sad
i used bc of the cultural Rick and Morty meme
but really i want to create a euphoric Living Digital Garden for all of my Virtual Egregores big and small

my knowledge bots role rn is small
it just notes what changed
but behind this small bot is a big ai

and so i started thinking: what is the smallest possible egregore?
