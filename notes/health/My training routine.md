I'm currently doing basic band and body weight exercises daily as a way to ease back into my training, usually 6-12 sets (1 set per major body part). I haven't worked out much since becoming [[Homeless]] in 2016, though prior to that I was into powerlifting and HIIT.

My goal for 2024 is to learn Calisthenics and Yoga.
