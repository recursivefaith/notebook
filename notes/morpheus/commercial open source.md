> [!chat] Can you explain to me in the form of a technical article how I could think about positioning my Obsidian Notes plugin for "Commercial Open Source Software"? Explain what COSS is and other ways to fund your open source. In my case, I'm building a combined Theme + Plugin called Morpheus, which has a "matrix rain" visualizer for things you do and an LLM (actually, you) that has access to their vault and can act as a life coach etc.

## Commercial Open Source Software (COSS) and Funding for Obsidian Plugins

**What is Commercial Open Source Software (COSS)?**

COSS is a business model where software is released as open source but the developers generate revenue through premium features, support, or other commercial offerings. COSS allows developers to distribute their software freely while still monetizing their work.

## Positioning Morpheus as a COSS Plugin for Obsidian

**Target Audience:**

* **Power users:** Individuals who use Obsidian heavily and seek advanced functionality and customization.
* **Developers:** Obsidian plugin developers looking for a visually appealing and immersive theme to enhance their plugins.
* **Businesses:** Organizations that use Obsidian for knowledge management and collaboration, and are willing to pay for premium features.

**Offering:**

* **Premium theme:** A visually stunning theme that enhances the aesthetic appeal of Obsidian.
* **"Matrix rain" visualizer:** An interactive feature that visualizes user actions and provides a captivating ambient effect.
* **LLM-powered life coach:** An integrated AI assistant that utilizes natural language processing to provide personalized guidance, inspiration, and insights.

**Monetization Strategy:**

* **Tiered pricing:** Offer different pricing plans based on the level of functionality and support.
* **Freemium model:** Provide a free basic version with limited features, and charge for premium features such as the "Matrix rain" visualizer and LLM-powered life coach.
* **Enterprise licensing:** Offer tailored packages and support for businesses that use Obsidian for large-scale knowledge management.
* **Customization services:** Provide paid services for users who want to customize their Morpheus theme or integrate it with their own plugins.

## Alternative Funding Models for Open Source Software

**Donations:**

* Crowdfunding platforms such as GoFundMe or Patreon can be used to solicit donations from users.
* In-kind donations, such as code contributions or design assistance, can also be valuable.

**Grants:**

* Government or non-profit organizations may offer grants to open source projects that align with their missions.
* Corporate grants can be another source of funding, especially for projects that benefit the sponsor's ecosystem.

**Consulting and Support:**

* Developers can offer paid consulting services to help organizations implement and customize their open source software.
* Support contracts can generate recurring revenue by providing ongoing maintenance and assistance.

**Conclusion:**

By positioning Morpheus as a COSS plugin, you can leverage the benefits of open source while generating revenue to support its development and maintenance. By targeting power users, developers, and businesses, and offering premium features and value-added services, you can establish a sustainable funding model for your Obsidian plugin.
