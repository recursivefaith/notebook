Focuses on developing advanced tooling for knowledge graphs to support AGI systems. Goals include enhancing capabilities for knowledge representation and processing, covering the full lifecycle from data extraction to benchmarking, with optional integration into the OpenCog Hyperon framework. Ideal for work on LLM-to-KG consistency and creating robust evaluation suites.
