The "Rising Tide Challenge" is a competition hosted by Blue Ocean Games, an early-stage venture fund, designed to discover and fund new indie game creators. The challenge is structured as a "trailer jam," where participants submit a short, in-engine game concept trailer to showcase their idea. The goal is to provide funding and market validation for developers who may not fit traditional investment models.

The competition features two distinct tracks:
*   **In-Development Track:** This is for developers with active game projects. Winners are selected through a combination of public voting and a judging panel. They receive cash prizes and are invited to pitch for up to $300,000 in funding.
*   **Idea-Only Track:** This track is aimed at creators who have a game concept but may not have the experience to develop it. Winners can receive $1,000 for Blue Ocean Games to option the idea. If a development partner is secured, the original creator could earn $25,000 for their intellectual property.

The submission deadline for the current challenge is September 22, 2025, at 12:00 PM PST.
