Focuses on experimenting with concept blending within the MeTTa platform. Goals include exploring innovative ways to integrate and blend concepts, including formal concept analysis (FCA, fuzzy/paraconsistent variants) implemented in MeTTa within Hyperon. Ideal for pipelines that generate new concepts from noisy data, with creativity/efficiency metrics and reproducible evaluation.
