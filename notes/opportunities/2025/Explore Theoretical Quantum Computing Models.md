Aims to explore theoretical models for quantum computing, with a focus on their application to AGI. Goals include advancing understanding and potential implementations of various quantum computing architectures (trapped-ion, superconducting, etc.) for AGI workloads. Proposals should explore the practicality and limitations of these approaches for tasks like probabilistic reasoning and large-scale knowledge representation.
