## Why it will work

> **Extending reality is possible:**
>- it's possible to [[notes/Augmented Reality|augment reality]]
> - it's possible to create your own [[notes/Mesh Networking|mesh network]]
>- it's possible to trade [[notes/Crypto|crypto]] through mesh networks
>- it's possible to vibe code any interface you need for any data
>- it's possible to use mesh networked crypto to run a Network State
>- this can happen agentically

## How it will work

>  **You can bootstrap realities with QR Codes:**
> - it's possible to create [[tutorials/Generative QR Codes|Generative QR Codes]]
>- it's possible to create generative [[notes/Mesh Networking|mesh networked]] qr codes
>- it's possible for qr codes to generate [[notes/WebXR]] experiences
>- it's possible to make qr codes by hand
>- it's possible to make qr codes from literally dirt

**Therefore from literally the dirt on the ground you can bootstrap a real-alternate reality with augmented ⁠[[Embodied Symbients]] that [[interfaces]] with physical reality.**

## Preliminary Research

2024-2025 [[Living Digital Gardens]] ([[notes/epiphanies/Gnosis Copilot|Gnosis Copilot]])
2022-2025 [[Recursive Interfaces]] (Win9x)
2021-2023 [[Visual interfaces]] (ModelPrompter)
2018-2021 [[Handsfree Interfaces]] (Handsfree.js)
2014-2018 [[Multiuser Interfaces]] (Linkshow)
2011-2015 [[Modular Interfaces]] (Stemlet)

## Funding Goals
- $500 to bootstrap "[[Living Digital Gardens]]"
	- Thermal printer for [[tutorials/Generative QR Codes|Generative QR Codes]]
	- API costs
- $5k to cover my [[extended reality]] research goals
	- 3D Printers and supplies
	- Extended reality equipment (projector, AR glasses)
- $50k would give me financial agency
	- Start local meetup group
	- Attend/host conferences
- $250k so I can start a [[robot commune]] and research/residency center
	- Down payment on land
	- A few humanoid robots/drones to practice with
