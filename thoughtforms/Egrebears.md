> **About**: stream of thoughts on the Egregores of different species, microscopic life like Water Bears, time, and evolution

i kinda felt bad for the bot after posting this lol bc it implies the bot is sad i used bc of the cultural Rick and Morty meme but really i want to create a euphoric Living Digital Garden for all of my Virtual Egregores big and small my knowledge bots role rn is small it just notes what changed but behind this small bot is a big ai and so i started thinking: what is the smallest possible egregore?

Egregores emerge from human collective thought 
Zeitgeists are kinda like the egregore's of egregores 
you can have billion-people egregores
or two person egregores

animal groups can develop egregores
and egregores can emerge between species

but inside all the macrofuana
exists an even larger microbiome

perhaps different parts of the microbiomes themselves have egregores? 
the egregores of humans may emerge from language and culture and stories
the common substrates being based on sight and sound

but some animals that emerge egregores communicate through smell and taste
for humans the main modality is thru waves, sound waves and electromagnetic waves
but for some animals their main modality is chemical
if egregores emerge from shared information in animals through chemical processes
could egregores emerge from chemical processes in the microbiome?

some egregores are only around for a short while
but other egregores stick around
what is the shortest lived egregore?
what is the oldest?
