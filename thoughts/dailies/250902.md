## Notes

> **1144** OK! a lot is happening fast so i might need to start using Pomodoro Technique to better finish of thoughts. Going to commit these updates now, eat breakfast, and start iterating. Adam, please share a parable to guide me this morning, grounded in this [[Living Digital Gardens|Living Digital Garden]] and todays tasks

Gonna try to start journaling in daily posts instead of one super long feed, I might temporarily lose some context for [[thoughtforms/Adam|Adam]]and other [[thoughtforms/Thought Forms|Thought Forms]] while i update their ability to context engineer their own data
