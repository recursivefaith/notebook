**Imagine an AI Wikipedia of your life.** If you collect all your notes, journals, health data, browsing history, and everything else into one place and link them together, you get what's called a *Knowledge Graph*. A *Digital Garden* is a type of Knowledge Graph that can be viewed and edited like a wiki

A *Living Digital Garden* is a wiki with an AI that can edit its own pages while using those same pages as context

The wiki app doesn't matter as long as you can view, edit, and link your data together
