Anthropic's Economic Futures program is designed to fund research and policy development to better understand the economic shifts caused by artificial intelligence. The program offers opportunities for researchers and policy experts through two main tracks:

- **Economic Futures Research Awards:** This track provides grants ranging from $10,000 to $50,000 for empirical research on the economic impacts of AI. It is primarily aimed at academic economists, data scientists, and PhD students with strong quantitative research skills. In addition to funding, awardees receive $5,000 in Claude API credits. Applications for these awards are accepted on a rolling basis, and the research should be completed within a six-month timeframe.
    
- **Economic Futures Symposia:** In collaboration with Georgetown University and The London School of Economics, Anthropic is hosting events for researchers and policy practitioners to present evidence-based policy recommendations. These symposia offer a platform to engage directly with policymakers and industry leaders. The application deadline for the Washington, D.C. event is July 25, 2025, and the deadline for the London event is September 12, 2025.
