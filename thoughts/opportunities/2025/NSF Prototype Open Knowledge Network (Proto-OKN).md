The NSF's "Building the Prototype Open Knowledge Network" (Proto-OKN) initiative funds projects to create and deploy knowledge graphs that can be interconnected into a nationwide network. The program supports both the creation of new knowledge graphs and the development of tools to link existing ones, with a focus on addressing societal challenges. Awards are typically in the range of $300,0.
