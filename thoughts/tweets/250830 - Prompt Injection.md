prompt injection is often seen as an attack...in the quoted post Pliny prompt injects the internet

but personal knowledge bases are like "localized Internets"

instead of prompt injecting as an "attack", you can use it to "reprogram" your knowledge bots w/o updating their code

ex: i capture all my notes, code, browsing history in one place

i then have an agent that uses that as context to "think like me" to help me manage my life

turns out prompt injection can be used to "steer" knowledge agents thru context alone (no code)
